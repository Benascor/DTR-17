1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?

I expect that our team will be able to accomplish all the work that is assigned to us.

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?

Because I already work in the software industry, my plan is to improve my teamwork and communication skills by exposing myself to as many new teamwork methods and communication tools as possible to broaden my skills and be able to adapt to more types of work environments.

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?

Other team members may want implement things in a different way than I would, so it might be difficult to either accept their way of doing things or reach a compromise.

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?

The best thing to do in this situation is to simply do your best to make sure that everybody is working cohesively and contributing equally, which should lead to getting an A regardless of what individual standards other people might have.

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?

So long as everybody puts forth the same amount of effort, it is okay for some members to contribute more to the project if they have more skill or knowledge regarding the problem that needs to be solved.

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?

Around 6 hours per week.

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

The person who feels the most comfortable working on each individual problem should be the one who works on it unless they are already occupied with another task.

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

We will try to talk to them and convince them to pull their weight. Knowing that other people are reliant on you is often a very powerful motivating force, so the best thing to do would be to make sure to remind of them of that and do everything possible to avoid simply ignoring the problem.

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?

The person who believes the quality of the work is to be higher should suggest ways of improving the work. If they are not able to, they should let it be.

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

Everyone should be able to work according to their own habits so long as they are able to complete the tasks that they are assigned. 

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?

It will likely not be necessary since we should be able to collaborate remotely and in class in addition to meeting outside of class whenever we are required to do so.

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?

Perhaps once a week.

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

In general, yes. If one person disagrees, they should at least be willing to acquiesce to the other teammates’ position, but if they disagree entirely then a compromise should be reached.

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?

Same answer as above.

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position?  How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?

The facilitator position should be given to whoever is naturally the most willing to facilitate.

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

If the other team members seem to be okay with it, allow it to occur. If not, communicate to that person that they should let the others be involved in the decision-making process.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

Communicate to make sure that I am giving my teammates the chance to be involved in the decision-making process and that I am not being domineering by accident.

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?

I can be reached via email at all hours. My emails are sent to my phone, so I typically receive them almost immediately.
