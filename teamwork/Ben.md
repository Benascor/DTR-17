INTJ

1. I'm hoping to learn how to work effectively as a team since every class I've taken has been individual work so far.

2. My main one is to learn how to use Github so that I can understand how to use cooperative tools for coding.

3. Well hopefully we'll be a compatible team and it'll be easy to work together as a team effectively.

4. I think we'll find a healthy compromise and hopefully our team can put in the work to get an "A" anyways.

5. We should evenly distribute the work and strive for an "A" anyways. If the assignment is worth doing, it's worth doing well.

6. I'd say probably about 6-8 hours a week.

7. I think we should assign it based off of who is best at, or most interested in, what parts of the assignment.

8. We beat them up... not really. We should probably just make sure the rest of the team helps them finish up their part and hopefully we would all be willing to do that for each other if someone falls behind.

9. If that happens then we should discuss what our idea of quality work is and come to a compromise.

10. I think we should try to accommodate all work habits unless it's procrastination.

11. That would depend on our schedules in my opinion.

12. Probably once every week.

13. I'd say so. There's only 3 of us so you really only need the approval of 2 other people. That's not too hard really.

14. Try to figure out why the 3rd doesn't agree and try to change the decision to accommodate their reasoning.

15. I think we should just go in order and that way everyone gets a chance to be facilitator. As for how often, I'm honestly not sure but I'd love to hear your opinions.

16. Well hopefully they're dominating the team process because they're good at it, but if it's an issue, we should just bring it up to them and work out a solution.

17. I would bring it up to the team and voice my concerns.

18. Generally text and at any hours. If I'm busy, or asleep, I'll answer it as soon as I can.
