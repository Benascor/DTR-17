Personality Type: INFP AKA Luke Skywalker

1. I expect we will create a solid product that does all the required tasks.

2. I want to make sure to communicate if I have problems or issues that I think need to be address. 

3. Conflicting ideas of how to accomplish our goals.

4. We should all be aiming for an A, but I think we are all high achievers and will do the best we can.

5. If someone wants to push harder for an A thats their choice, but I dont think we will have an issue.

6. I have lots of free time, so whatever it takes to accomplish what we want.

7. By talking it out, not sure until we get there.

8. Take away a gold star from next to their name. If theres no excuse then thats bad, but if they just didnt care to do it then we will probably have to get onto them.

9. Then we are in a pickle and have to compromise.

10. Talk it out and work on it if it arises. 

11. I dont think we need one as it stands but a work time would be nice to have if theres a universal time open. If not, text isnt too bad.

12. Atleast once a week if we can in person, otherwise talking throughout the week.

13. If it is a large decision then yes, otherwise if it doesnt directly influence the parts another is working on then I dont think so. But communicate it to the group that you chose X.

14. The one will have to concede i would think. Or convince the other two.

15. I dont think we need a facilitator for this. We are all pretty laid back people.

16. If someone does, it sounds like they want to lead, and as long as they dont step on the others, thats ok with me.

17. Talk to the rest of the group and let them know.

18. Anytime. Mornings are bad, but I'm up late. text is best, email 2nd.
