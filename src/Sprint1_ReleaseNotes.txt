What is done:
	-Command line supported with flags for option to display mileage, place names, and place IDs on the trip map.
	-Constructs a trip from a list of destinations given in the CSV file.
	-Produces svg map of the constructed trip.
	-Produces an XML itinerary for the constructed trip.
	-Uses the nearest neighbor algorithm to produce a short trip.
	-JUnit testing has been added to test all testable code and insure product quality.
	
What is not done:
	-Command line argument parsing is currently very basic and does not know how to deal with flags given as
	multiple arguments such as TripCo -m -i places.csv
	-Only minimal error handling for bad files, ect. is currently in place.
	
Command line instructions:
	TripCo.java -flags inputfile.csv
		Recognized flags are:
		-m for adding mileages to the map
		-i for adding IDs to the map
		-n for adding Names to the map
		
	For example, to execute the program and display the mileages and the place names, the user would type:
		TripCo.java -mn places.csv
		
	Only the labels for ID or Name can be turned on, not both! The system will only show ID labels instead 
	of both, if they are both flagged.
	
	The output will be in the same directory as the file given as the argument. So if the user gives a relative 
	path for the filename, the output will generated in that directory.
